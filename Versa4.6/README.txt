You can drag and drop these folders into an empty project at https://studio.fitbit.com

UPDATED 6.4.2023

Project updates made by Ethan Rabe, Hunter Barton, and Dominic Mosley.

This project is made of two components: A webserver made to handle data storage and access and a watchface application built for fitbit OS 4.6*

An AWS Server currently exists for the webserver. For senior project groups looking to continue working on this project, contact Ethan Rabe at erabe@ewu.edu or ethanrabe05@gmail.com for access the aws server.

For building the fitbit application onto a device, refer to fitbit developer documentation at https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/ and https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/command-line-interface/

This build will have issues on different device models other than versa. In order to run on other devices, some files may need to be renamed, and dependancies will need to be updated in package.json.
